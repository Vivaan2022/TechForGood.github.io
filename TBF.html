<p class="text"><b>We live in an evolving world, one that is changing every day. This is a process that is fueled by technology. Innovation is impacting us today defining the future, and it is up to us to 
determine the path that takes. The technology that will take us forward can be built on sound, ethical, smart principals. It can invite unique perspectives. It can provide empowerment, 
knowledge, awareness, access, and community.<br><br>
As we develop the technology of the future, we can work towards creating a better world long term. This means many different things as technology merges with all parts of our lives. For 
example, EdTech (education technology) can make knowledge more accessible globally and algorithms have the potential to remove or alleviate human bias.<br><br>The flip side is the serious 
potential for harm if the systems that we use arenâ€™t being developed by people that have diverse perspectives. When we fail to be inclusive there are massive oversights that can lead to 
disastrous effects.</b></p>

<p class="text"><b>One clear example that we can look back at today is the development of vehicles. According to the NHTSA women are 17% more likely to be killed in a car accident and 73% 
more likely to be injured. This is attributed to a number of factors, but the most egregious is the lack of women involved in designing the testing done to ensure the safety of automobiles.
<br><br>If the technologies we are developing and integrating into our society are 73% more harmful to women or underrepresented groups then every company has a clear opportunity to provide a 
better product by having diversity of thought and leadership. There is hope thanks to technology leaders like Kesha Williams, an AWS Training Architect at A Cloud Guru, who recently spoke about the importance of diversity in development teams at 
WWCode CONNECT Digital Conference. </b></p>
